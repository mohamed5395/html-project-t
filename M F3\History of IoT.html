        Kevin Ashton, co-founder of the Auto-ID Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), first mentioned 
        the internet of things in a presentation he made to Procter & Gamble (P&G) in 1999. Wanting to bring radio frequency ID (RFID) 
        to the attention of P&G's senior management, Ashton called his presentation "Internet of Things" to incorporate the cool new trend of 
        1999: the internet. MIT professor Neil Gershenfeld's book, When Things Start to Think, also appeared in 1999. 
        It didn't use the exact term but provided a clear vision of where IoT was headed.<br>
        IoT has evolved from the convergence of wireless technologies, microelectromechanical systems (MEMSes), microservices and the internet.
        The convergence has helped tear down the silos between operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT), 
        enabling unstructured machine-generated data to be analyzed for insights to drive improvements.<br>
        Although Ashton's was the first mention of the internet of things, the idea of connected devices has been around since the 1970s, 
        under the monikers embedded internet and pervasive computing.<br>
        The first internet appliance, for example, was a Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University in the early 1980s. 
        Using the web, programmers could check the status of the machine and determine whether there would be a cold drink awaiting them, 
        should they decide to make the trip to the machine.<br>
        The internet of things is also a natural extension of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), 
        a category of software application programs for process control, the gathering of data in real time from remote locations 
        to control equipment and conditions. SCADA systems include hardware and software components. 
        The hardware gathers and feeds data into a computer that has SCADA software installed, where it is then processed and 
        presented in a timely manner. The evolution of SCADA is such that late-generation SCADA systems developed 
        into first-generation IoT systems.<br>
        he concept of the IoT ecosystem, however, didn't really come into its own until the middle of 2010 when, in part, 
        the government of China said it would make IoT a strategic priority in its five-year plan.<br>
