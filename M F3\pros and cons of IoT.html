        <b>Some advantages of IoT include the following:</b> <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                ability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device;
            </li>
            <li>
                improved communication between connected electronic devices;
            </li>
            <li>
                transferring data packets over a connected network saving time and money;
            </li>
            <li>
                automating tasks helping to improve the quality of a business's services and reducing the need for human intervention.

        </ul>
        <b>Some disadvantages of IoT include the following:</b> <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases
            </li>
            <li>
                Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers maybe even millions of IoT devices, and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging. 
            </li>
            <li>
                If there's a bug in the system, it's likely that every connected device will become corrupted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Since there's no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it's difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.
            </li>
        </ul>
